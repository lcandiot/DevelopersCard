Collection of showcase applications that I have developed over the years. 

## Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers
Fluid flow through porous media is an important process controlling the subsurface dynamics such as geological reservoirs, and filtration systems. The movie below shows porous convection across a 2D domain. To calculate the fluid motion through the pore space, Darcy's equation is coupled to the Heat equation. The solution is obtained iteratively applying a pseudo-transient time stepping method.
