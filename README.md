## Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers
Fluid flow through porous media is an important process controlling the subsurface dynamics such as geological reservoirs, and filtration systems. The movie below shows porous convection across a 2D domain. To calculate the fluid motion through the pore space, Darcy's equation is coupled to the Heat equation. The solution is obtained iteratively applying a pseudo-transient time stepping method.

Method: central finite differences
Time integration: fully implicit
Advection scheme: upwind (first order)
Programmed language: Julia
Parallelization: no
