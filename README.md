## Ordinary differential equations (ODE) solvers in Julia
### The damped harmonic oscillator
A classical physical example of an ODE is the damped harmonic oscillator. Consider the following equation that describes the motion of a damped spring
```math
  m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx -c\frac{dx}{dt}.
```
This equation can be rewritten in the following way
```math
  \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x + 2\zeta \omega \frac{dx}{dt} = 0 ,
```
where $$\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$$ and $$\zeta = c / 2 / \sqrt{mk}$$, and solved to using the Julia package [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/).
The movie below shows the results obtained by the script [dampedHarmonicOscillator.jl](https://github.com/lcandiot/DevelopersCard/blob/main/Solvers/ODEs/dampedHarmonicOscillator.jl)

## Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers
### Porous convection
Porous convection is an important physical process that describes the dynamics of fluid extraction from an essentially undeforming solid in a multiphase aggregate. Applications include industrial filtration systems, subsurface hydrogeological reservoirs, or melt extraction below a volcano. The movie below shows porous convection across a 2D domain. To calculate the fluid motion through the pore space, Darcy's equation is coupled to the Heat equation. The solution is obtained iteratively applying a pseudo-transient time stepping method.

### Analytical solutions
For benchmarking purposes it is useful to compare the numerical solution to analytical solutions. For some equations it is possible to derive a solution analytically for others they do not exist. In this section, I showcase a 1D Diffusion-Convection equation for which I have derived an [analytical solution](https://github.com/lcandiot/DevelopersCard/blob/main/Solvers/Diffusion/Derivation_DiffusionConvection.md) assuming an initial normal (or Gaussian) distribution of a scalar quantity and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. As shown in the movie below the numerical fits the analytical solution up to an acceptable tolerance.

## Data Analysis
### Fitting data using neural networks
The following figure shows an example of fitting the temperature-dependent rock density using neural networks. The linear regression algorithm was developed using the Flux.jl package.

## Numerical Methods
### Newton-Raphson iterative solution procedure
This technique allows to find the root of any function $f(x)$. Solution procedure starts by defining an initial guess ($x_n$), ideal already close to the solution. Determining the derivate $f'(x_n)$ and its root gives a new guess $x_{n+1}$ which is closer to the solution than the guess before. Repeat this procedure either until $|x_{n+1} - x_n| < \varepsilon$ or $f(x_{n+1}) \approx 0$. An advantage of the Newton-Raphson iteration is that convergence is quadratically in the vicinity of the root, reducing the computational cost. The example below shows the Newton-Raphson iterative solution procedure to find the root of $f(x) = x^2 - 2$. The derivative $f'(x_n)$ is calculated (1) analytically, (2) numerically as difference between $x_n$ and a perturbation of $x_n$ approximation, (3) via the Julia package **Zygote.jl** which enables automatic differentiation of any function. Note the scatter plot in the right panel indeed shows a quadratic convergence behaviour.

This and similar methods are widely used in optimization algorithms and PDE solvers. I have also used this technique to find the liquidus temperature of geomaterials as a function of pressure and chemical composition.
